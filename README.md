## How The Game Works
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

## How To Play The Game
just click on the arrows of your keyboard:

    >left arrow key>> move to left
    >right arrow key>> move to right
    >down arrow key>> move to down
    >up arrow key>> move to up
    
The game ends when all tries ends or if you reach to the water 10 times.
